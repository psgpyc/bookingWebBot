### Install Dependencies
It's recommended to use a virtual environment. You can set it up as follows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Each script in the repository is designed for specific tasks. Here's how you can use them:
1. **Configure the script**: Modify the script parameters, such as URLs and search terms, to suit your needs.
2. **Run the script**: Execute the script using Python.

## Examples

### Example 1: Scraping a News Website
This example demonstrates how to scrape headlines from a news website.
```python
# Example code snippet
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

url = 'https://newswebsite.com'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

headlines = soup.find_all('h2', class_='headline')
for headline in headlines:
    print(headline.text)
```

### Example 2: Automating Form Submission
This example shows how to automate form submission using Selenium.
```python
# Example code snippet
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get('https://example.com/form')

username = driver.find_element_by_name('username')
password = driver.find_element_by_name('password')

username.send_keys('your_username')
password.send_keys('your_password')

submit_button = driver.find_element_by_name('submit')
submit_button.click()
```
